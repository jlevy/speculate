Shortcut: New Feature Implementation

Instructions:

1. Make sure it’s clear what Feature Plan doc will be used for this implementation.
   The user should provide it and you should find it in @docs/project/specs/active/ with
   a plan- prefix (e.g., plan-YYYY-MM-DD-*.md).
   If isn’t clear, stop and ask!

2. Copy @docs/project/specs/template-implementation-spec.md to
   @docs/project/specs/active/impl-YYYY-MM-DD-feature-some-description.md (filling in
   the date and the appropriate description of the feature, matching the Feature Plan
   filename stem, replacing plan- with impl-)

3. Fill in the new implementation spec, asking for clarifications as soon as you need
   them.

4. Summarize what you have done and ask the user to review and if you should begin
   implementation.
