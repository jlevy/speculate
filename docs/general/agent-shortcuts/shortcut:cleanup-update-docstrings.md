Shortcut: Update Docstrings

Instructions:

Review all major functions and types and ensure they have a *concise* docstring
explaining their purpose.

- Focus on any rationale or purpose.

- Do NOT state obvious things about the code.

This should cover

- Public types

- Major functions

- Convex schemas, functions, actions, mutations, and queries

It should NOT cover:

- Test functions

- Trivial internal helper functions
