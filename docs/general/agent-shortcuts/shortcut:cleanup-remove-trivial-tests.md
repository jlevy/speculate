Shortcut: Remove Trivial Tests

Instructions:

Review @docs/general/agent-rules/general-testing-rules.md and in particular look through
all tests that have been added and look for trivial tests that are not adding any value
and remove them.

For example, some tests may simply be testing a declared value matches what it was set
to. Do preserve tests that are non-trivial or add to coverage in a meaningful way.
